Exercise: Create a Simple To-Do List App
Write a Swift command-line program that allows a user to create, view, and manage a simple to-do list. The user should be able to perform the following actions:

Add a task – The user can add a task to the list.
View tasks – Display all tasks on the list with their statuses (whether completed or not).
Mark a task as completed – The user can mark any task as completed.
Remove a task – The user can remove a task from the list.
Quit – The user can exit the application.

Requirements:
Use a Task struct to represent a task with properties for the task's name and completion status.
Use an array to store tasks.
Implement input handling so the user can interact with the program through a text-based menu.

Sample Menu:
Simple To-Do List
1. Add a new task
2. View all tasks
3. Mark a task as completed
4. Remove a task
5. Quit

Sample Output:
Simple To-Do List
1. Add a new task
2. View all tasks
3. Mark a task as completed
4. Remove a task
5. Quit
Enter your choice: 2

Tasks:
1. [ ] Buy groceries
2. [ ] Finish homework
3. [X] Call mom

Tips:
Use a loop to continually show the menu until the user chooses to quit.
Use readLine() to handle user input.
Make sure the tasks are numbered, and provide clear instructions for each action.
